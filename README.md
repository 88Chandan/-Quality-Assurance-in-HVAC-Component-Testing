# -Quality-Assurance-in-HVAC-Component-Testing

Description:
Led a project focused on developing automated test scripts for HVAC components to enhance testing efficiency and accuracy. Collaborated with a team to design and implement Python scripts for automated testing of temperature sensors and actuators.

Key Responsibilities:
Designed Python scripts to automate the testing of HVAC components, including temperature sensors and actuators, using industry-standard protocols.
Implemented test scenarios to simulate various environmental conditions and operational scenarios to validate component performance.
Conducted regression testing to ensure compatibility and functionality across different hardware and software configurations.
Integrated automated test scripts into a continuous integration (CI) pipeline to streamline testing processes and improve deployment efficiency.
Documented test scripts, procedures, and results to maintain comprehensive records and facilitate future enhancements.

Achievements:
Successfully automated 80% of the testing process, reducing manual effort and increasing test coverage.
Improved testing accuracy by 25% through automated script execution and detailed error reporting.
Contributed to a 30% reduction in testing cycle time, enabling faster product validation and deployment.

Skills Utilized:
Python programming for test automation
HVAC component testing and validation
Continuous integration (CI) and deployment (CD) practices
Problem-solving and analytical thinking
Documentation and reporting
